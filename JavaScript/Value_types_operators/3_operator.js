// There are two types of Operators

// Unary
typeof 1 /* gives Number */
!false /* gives true*/
// and many more

// Binary
// + - / * (arithmetic)
// It basically follows the BODMAS methods


// remainder operator
// % 
// What is does is that,when this is applied upon two numbers then their remainder is obtained

// 5%2 will give 1

// Special Numbers
// -infinity , +infinity and NaN
// They dont act like numbers but their type is number

// Logical Operators
// Js goes from left to right to do so (This is called 'logical short-circuit')
// both in '||' and '&&' comparison js does this
/*
'||' --- It checks if the left one is true or false if converted into boolean
if it is true then all evaluated to true if not then the expression will be evaluated as what the right one is evaluated to
for example -- true or false gives true,
                false or true gives false

'&&' -- same as above---If left is false then false otherwise all will be evaluated to what right one is evaluated to
for example --- false and true gives false
                true and false gives false
