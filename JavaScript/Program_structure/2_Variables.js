/*We know that when we write anything in programming,a certain pattern
of bits is created in the memory but after the use of that thing,the pattern get recycled and the existence of that thing
no longer remains
*/

/*
1. Variables are any random word written under certain rules to stick the value of an expression
2. It prevents the recycling of those bit patterns so that,things stored in a variable can be used later in the program
3. They are not box that contain values,they are like ropes that get attach to them
4. Same value can be attached to many variables
*/


/*
1. Keywords and reserve words are those words which a variable can not take
2. Those words are fixed in programming languages to do certain task
3. For example-- for,foreach,while,break,continue,return and manymore
