// Sometime we wish the program to be keep executing ultil some condition is true
// for example, keep adding 2 to number x until x is equal to 20
// we can do this by hand but what if the number is 10000 ?
// Here in these cases,  we can use some reserve words to do the job for us
// those words are, for/while/do-while
// Why so many words when doing the same repitition work?
// They are quite different in syntax and used in certain condition
// looping is also called iteration

/*
for(declaration of a variable ; certain condition ; certain action on that condition){
    statements with or without control flow;
}

In for loop, we first set counter to how many times we want the statement to be executed 
and then we arite the statmentes that we want to execute
*/

/*
declaration of a variable
while(certain condition){
    statements to be executed on those condition
}

in while loop, we just write a condition on the variable declared before the loop
and then we write the statements to be executed
*/

/*
do{
    statements to be executed with or without a control flow 
    or declaration of a variable or anything 
}while(a condition to make the above things keep executing until this condition is true);

/*
Break -- It allows to jump out of the loop(for and while) with or without a condition
continue -- It allows to jump to the next iteration with or withour a condition
